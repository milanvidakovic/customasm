# customasm
This fork is different in two things:
  - has one more output format: -f hexdump2 which exports the machine code into the LogiSim RAM/ROM content file format
  - has #str16 keyword which creates 16-bit strings with the same sytax as #str
  
This is an assembler that takes custom instruction set definitions
and uses them to assemble source files.  
This can be useful if you'd like to test out a new virtual machine's bytecode,
or even if you're eager to write programs for that new processor architecture 
you just implemented in FPGA!

Usage: customasm [options] <instrset-file> <asm-file>

Options:
    -h, --help          Display this information.
    -v, --version       Display version information.
    -q, --quiet         Suppress progress reports.
    -f, --format FORMAT The format of the output file. Possible formats:
                        binary, binstr, hexstr, bindump, hexdump, hexdump2 <-- for the LogiSim
    -o, --out-data FILE The name of the output file. (Default: a.out)
        --stdout        Write output to stdout instead of a file.
```

The idea is that, given the following Instruction Set file:

```
#align 8

load r1, {value} -> 8'0x11 @ value[7:0]
load r2, {value} -> 8'0x12 @ value[7:0]
load r3, {value} -> 8'0x13 @ value[7:0]
add  r1, r2      -> 8'0x21
sub  r3, {value} -> 8'0x33 @ value[7:0]
jnz  {address}   -> 8'0x40 @ address[15:0]
ret              -> 8'0x50
```

...the assembler would take the following Source file:

```
#addr 0x8000

multiply3x4:
	load r1, 0
	load r2, 3
	load r3, 4
	
	.loop:
		add r1, r2
		sub r3, 1
		jnz .loop
	
	ret
```

...and convert it into a binary file with the following contents:

```
0x11 0x00
0x12 0x03
0x13 0x04
0x21
0x33 0x01
0x40 0x80 0x06
0x50
```
